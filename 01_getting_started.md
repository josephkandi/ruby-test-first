# Chapter 1: Getting Started

Welcome! You are about to embark on an exciting learning experience. If you have never done any programming previously, don’t worry: this book will teach you all you need to know to begin writing real programs with the Ruby language. If you are an experienced programmer, you will be learning test-first development in a new and different way. Either way, I think you will find something in this book that is novel, interesting, and fun!

## What you will need

This book is for anyone, regardless of previous programming experience. All the tools needed, including the [Ruby language](http://www.ruby-lang.org) itself, are free and open source. You needn’t spend one cent to get started working through this book.

### Operating system

This book assumes that you are using a Unix-like operating system, such as Mac OS X or Linux. If you’re using some other operating system, however, don’t let that stop you: most of the examples should work anywhere.

### Ruby interpreter

You’ll need a Ruby interpreter, version 2.0.0 or higher. Some operating systems (such as Mac OS X) may come with one; to check the version, type `ruby -v` at a command prompt. If you don’t have a suitable Ruby interpreter, the easiest way to install one is to use a Ruby version manager, such as [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), [RVM](http://rvm.io), or [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby). It is probably easiest to follow their instructions, rather than trying to document all of them here.

If a version manager is not available for your environment, you can get a Ruby interpreter from http://www.ruby-lang.org.

### Text editor

Ruby source code, like that of most other programming languages, lives in plain text files. This means that you’ll need a good text editor.

If you’re an experienced programmer, you probably already have a text editor you like, and it probably has a Ruby syntax module available that you can install. One word of advice, though: if you are new to Ruby, and you usually use an IDE such as [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) or [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org), I strongly suggest _not_ using that IDE for Ruby. Due to the nature of Ruby, heavy IDEs tend to become more of a hindrance than a help; just use a plain old editor such as one recommended in the next paragraph.

If you’re a novice programmer, and you don’t already have a text editor you like, now is the time to play around with some and pick one! Your operating system probably came with a simple text editor (such as TextEdit on Mac OS X), and that will work, but a more sophisticated editor with features aimed at programmers will probably be helpful. If you want to work in a console environment, you can use a console editor such as [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or [Vim](http://www.vim.org); however, I prefer to use a good graphical editor. My current favorite is [Atom](http://atom.io), which was developed by the good folks at [GitHub](http://github.com); other popular choices (not necessarily free, though) include [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [TextMate](https://macromates.com/). Avoid using a word processor (such as [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word) or [LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org)): those programs were designed for producing formatted documents, not for efficiently manipulating plain text.

### Terminal emulator

You will need to be comfortable with your operating system’s command line (you don’t have to be a whiz, but you should know the basics). If you’re an experienced programmer, you probably are comfortable there already; if not, many tutorials are available for those of different operating systems.

To use the command line on a graphical system, you normally need to use an application known as a _terminal emulator_. Your OS almost certainly supplies one (e.g. Terminal.app on Mac OS X), but others are often available (such as [iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com), also for Mac OS X). As with text editors, they all get the job done, so pick one that has features that you like.

### Version control

TODO: expand this section

In the 21st century, no programmer should ever be without version control on any project. Choose a good version control system (I recommend [Git](http://git-scm.com)) and use it religiously.

Unfortunately, version control is beyond the scope of this book.
