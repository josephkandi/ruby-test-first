# Chapter 3: Your First Real Program

Now that we’ve got a [taste](02-hello-world.md) of how test-first development works, let’s learn some Ruby!

## A little more setup

In our “Hello World” example, we used a test library called Minitest. We did this because Minitest is part of Ruby’s standard library [TODO: removed from standard library as of 2.2—maybe we should just start with RSpec], so no additional installation was necessary. However, Minitest is a bit underpowered, and so for the rest of this book, we will be using a similar but more powerful tool called [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).

Since RSpec doesn’t come with our standard library, though, we have to install it. [TODO: more detailed instructions -- install Bundler, create `Gemfile` with RSpec, `bundle install`.]
