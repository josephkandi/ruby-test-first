# library
A collection of useful code designed to be used as a building block for writing programs. Most programming languages (including Ruby) include certain libraries as part of the standard distribution; these are collectively known as the standard library.

# standard library
The set of library routines that are distributed along with a language and thus require no further installation. The standard library routines can be assumed to be available wherever the language is installed.
